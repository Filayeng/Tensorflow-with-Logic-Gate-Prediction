# Tensorflow-with-Logic-Gate-Prediction-
I developed a system where an artificial neural network (ANN) learns predefined logic gates using TensorFlow. The model predicts binary outputs (0 or 1) based on user inputs. A PyQt5-based GUI enables real-time interaction, allowing users to simulate and test logic gate operations efficiently.
