I developed a system where the behavior of predefined logic gates is learned by an artificial neural network (ANN) using TensorFlow algorithms. The trained model classifies inputs and predicts the corresponding binary output (0 or 1). I also implemented a PyQt5-based GUI, allowing users to interact with the system and perform real-time logic gate simulations.
